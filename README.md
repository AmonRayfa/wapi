## Introduction

**Wapi** is a cross-platform command-line DDNS (Dynamic Domain Name System) client that keeps your DNS records up to date by
automatically adjusting them whenever your public IP address changes. This is especially useful for users running services on
home or private networks with dynamic IP addresses, ensuring their domain names always resolve to the correct IP address.

The client supports a wide range of domain registrars and DNS service providers (see [DNS-PROVIDERS](DNS-PROVIDERS.md)), making
it a versatile solution for managing your DNS records. It provides a user-friendly command-line, perfect for workflows involving
external scripts or automation tools, as well as a flexible Rust library for developers who want to integrate the client into
their own applications.

## Getting Started

In order to use **Wapi** in your project, you need to add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
wapi = "0.1"
```

If you want to use the command-line client, you can install it using `cargo`:

```sh
cargo install wapi
```

If you want to install `cargo`, you can do so by following the instructions on the
[Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
