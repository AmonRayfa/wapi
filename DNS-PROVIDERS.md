# Wapi DNS Providers

This file contains a list of DNS providers supported by the **Wapi** client, along with their identifiers and support status.
Identifiers are used to uniquely identify each provider in the client, while the support status indicates whether the provider
is currently supported by the client or not.

Supported providers are marked with a checkmark (✅), while providers that are pending support are marked with a clock (⏳).
Providers that cannot be supported due to restrictions or limitations (e.g. lack of public API) are marked with a cross (❌).
The list is updated regularly as new providers are added to the client.

Any feedback or suggestions for new providers or existing ones are welcome.

For information on how to use the project, please refer to the [README](README.md) file.
